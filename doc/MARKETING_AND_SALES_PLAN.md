**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Strategic Draft

## 1. Executive Summary

**Product:** AIJACK – The AI Tools Intelligence Platform.
**Core Value:** Shifting users from "searching for tools" to "finding solution stacks." We don't just list AI tools; we bundle them into actionable workflows (Stacks) tailored for specific professions.
**Target Audience:** Professionals (Architects, Marketers, Developers) who need AI to solve specific problems but are overwhelmed by the noise.

## 2. Future Monetization Opportunities

We will adopt a hybrid revenue model, starting with low-friction affiliate revenue and evolving into high-margin recurring SaaS/B2B revenue.

### Phase 1: Traffic & Trust (Current - Month 6)
*   **Affiliate Marketing (Core):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Earn commissions on "Click to Visit" and successful signups for listed tools.
    *   **Optimization:** Negotiate higher-tier rates with top-performing tools.
    *   **Transparency:** Use clear "Affiliate Link" labeling to build trust (unlike spammy aggregators).
*   **Sponsored Listings ("Featured Tools"):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Vendors pay for top placement in search results and category pages.
    *   **Format:** Non-intrusive "Promoted" badge.
    *   **Pricing:** Pay-per-week or Pay-per-click (PPC).

### Phase 2: User Value (Month 6 - 12)
*   **Pro Membership ($9 - $19/mo):**
    *   **Unlimited Stacks:** Save more than 5 personal stacks.
    *   **Exclusive Stacks:** Access to "Expert Workflows" curated by industry leaders (e.g., "The Senior Architect's Design Stack").
    *   **Advanced Search:** Access to "Power Filters" (e.g., filter by enterprise compliance, SSO availability).
    *   **Ad-Free Experience:** Remove sponsored listings.

### Phase 3: B2B & Data (Year 1+)
*   **Vendor Intelligence Portal:**
    *   **Data Product:** Sell analytics to Tool Vendors. "Who is searching for my competitor? What stacks is my tool often paired with?"
    *   **Claim Your Page:** Vendors pay a subscription to customize their tool landing page with rich media, case studies, and direct lead forms.
*   **Enterprise API:**
    *   Licensing our "Semantic Tool Search" API to other platforms (e.g., job boards, LMS platforms) that want to offer AI tool recommendations.

    *   *Format:* Problem -> Old Way -> New AI Stack -> Results.

    *   They drive traffic to their profile page on our site.
